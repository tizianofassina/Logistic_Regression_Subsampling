In the context of big data analysis, estimating statistical model parameters—or more generally, studying relationships between events and real-world phenomena—faces two main challenges:
	•	Insufficient data, which can limit the applicability of standard statistical methods.
	•	Excessively large datasets, which create computational limitations that make full-sample analysis impractical.

This work focuses on the latter problem: performing efficient analysis when the sample is too large to handle directly. Specifically, we present a theoretical approach for logistic regression showing how regression parameters can be effectively estimated using a carefully chosen subsample of the full dataset.

The repository includes:
	•	Theoretical results explaining the methodology.
	•	A Jupyter notebook with numerical simulations illustrating the approach.
